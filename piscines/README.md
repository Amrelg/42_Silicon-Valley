## Piscines

I'll put all of my work made during the Piscines, a kind of a bootcamp that
lasts roughly from 2 to 4 weeks, working 7 days a week, day and night.
These bootcamps cover the basics so there's no need to have any experience at
all. People will try and will fail, over and over again. This trial-and-error
process is necessary in order to find solutions to problems that once thought
impossible. People learn by working by yourself and in groups with other
students, without teachers. It can be done, and it works.
